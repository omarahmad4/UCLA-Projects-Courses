# UCLA Projects & Coursework Repository 📚🛠️

This repository is a curated collection of programming assignments, projects, and labs completed during my time as a Computer Engineering student at UCLA. The content spans a variety of courses and topics — from embedded systems and operating systems to functional programming, AI, and chip design.

## 🔍 Highlights

### 🖥️ C Projects

- **BeagleBone TCP Temperature Logger**
  - Embedded system built on BeagleBone Black.
  - Logs temperature sensor data and sends it via TCP.
  - Includes multithreading and file I/O.

- **Custom Malloc**
  - A custom memory allocator written from scratch.
  - Tests dynamic block allocation and boundary handling under stress.

- **Socket Communication (lab1b-server/client)**
  - Low-level network programming using TCP.
  - Simulates reliable data transmission over sockets.

---

### 🐚 Bash Scripting Tools

Includes custom scripts for:

- Detecting extra/missing UTF-8 headers
- Extracting ASCII and Unicode content
- Automating text processing for various file types

These scripts are small but powerful tools often used in systems courses or data-cleaning scenarios.

---

### 🧮 MATLAB

Scripts for signal analysis, controls simulation, and system modeling.

---

### 🧠 Functional & Logic Programming

- **OCaml**: Recursive structures, list manipulation, and functional design patterns.
- **Prolog**: Projects involving search, backtracking, and rule-based logic.

---

### 🐍 Python Projects

A variety of Python-based assignments across networking, embedded games, and image processing:

- **Asyncio Server**
  - Demonstrates concurrent network communication using Python's `asyncio`.

- **Character to Bitmap**
  - Generates bitmap visualizations of characters — potentially for display simulations.

- **Image Processing (OpenCV)**
  - Real-time camera-based tools:
    - Edge detection
    - Object tracking
    - RGB to grayscale conversion
    - Adaptive thresholding

- **Sphinx Sensor Network Game**
  - Multiplayer sensor-based game on Raspberry Pi.
  - Combines:
    - Distance detection (e.g., with ultrasonic sensors)
    - Real-time multiplayer logic over TCP sockets
    - Python-powered control and state handling

### 🧿 Cadence Chip Design

Used Cadence tools for a hands-on chip design assignment:

- **Artifacts**:
  - `schematic.jpg` – transistor-level design
  - `layout.jpg` – physical IC layout
  - `simulation setup.jpg` – testbench configuration
  - `test schematic.jpg` – logic test case

Even though the repo contains only screenshots, they reflect experience in full-cycle IC design from schematic to simulation.
