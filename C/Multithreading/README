Description of files:
lab2_list.c -- source file for program that does operations on a linked list with or without different types of synchronizations and yielding (to cause race conditions) and splits lists into lists sublists - outputs results in csv format
SortedList.h -- header file for linked list structure
SortedList.c -- implementation of linked list with forced yielding in specific locaitons if opt_yield is specified to cause race conditions
lab2_list.csv -- containing results of all test data for linked list program
graph.gp -- script to produce graphs from csv file
*.png -- graphs produced by both .gp files that show various correlations between iterations per thread, number of threads, yielding, synchronization methods, and cost per operation
README -- (this file) contains descriptions of files and answers to questions from the assignment spec
Makefile -- targets:
	 - default: builds executables lab2_add and lab2_list  with flags -Wall and -Wextra
	 - dist: creates tarball as requested by professor in autogradable format containing all files discussed above
	 - clean: removes executables, tarball, and any .o or .txt files 
	 - tests: test cases for lab2_list piped into the .csv file
	 - graphs: calls graph.gp script to produce graphs from .csv file
